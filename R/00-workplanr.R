#' \code{workplanr} package
#'
#'
#' The \code{workplanr} package is a SQLite dabase wrapper to plan concurrent projects with phases and deadlines.
#' It in intended for project manaers who need to track dealdlines and stff loads across multiple projects.
#' 
#' It is aimed to be a lightweight simple to use projec management tool to avoid the need for small teams to invest 
#' in large expensive project management tool infrastructure.
#' 
#' To build a workplan, the user needs to set the following project inputs
#' \itemize{
#' \item \strong{staff} A data frame of staff_name and staff capacity
#' \item Producing finalised charts for layout
#' \item Producing maps in IEP colours
#' }
#' 
#' 
#' These functions are intended to produce pdfs that are importable into illustrator
#' making the layout for comms much easier.
